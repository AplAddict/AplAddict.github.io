    <h2>How It Began</h2>
    <h5 style="margin-top: -12px;font-weight:normal;">Research</h5>
    <p>
        I began my capstone project making a smart walker to help out elderly people. However, due to challenges from
        Covid-19 I was forced to switch my project. I was trying to find something to occupy my time during quarantine
        when I walked past a LEGO car I built. I decided to retrofit my childhood toy with bluetooth, RGB lights, a
        gearbox motor, and a servo to make it actually functional. I linked up with a classmate, Jacob Singer, who
        offered to help with the coding.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why</h2>
    <h5 style="margin-top: -12px;font-weight:normal;">Empathize/Define</h5>
    <p>
        Like us, due to Covid-19, many people are stuck at home looking for things to keep them occupied. Building cars
        like ours provides a fun, easy, and educational way to spend your time. It builds problem solving skills while
        enhancing your knowledge of circuitry, C++, and Arduino. All that is required to do this on your own is a lego
        set large enough to accommodate all of the components (I used the <a style="color: white;"
            href="https://www.lego.com/en-my/service/buildinginstructions/search?initialsearch=8081#?text=8081">LEGO
            Technic Extreme Cruiser</a>), an Arduino, a bluetooth module, a servo motor, a gearbox motor, wires, and a
        bluetooth compatible device. You can even add LEDs, a piezzo buzzer, and much more like we did.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    <h5 style="margin-top: -12px;font-weight:normal;">Ideate/Prototype</h5>
    <p>
        While building this car we faced many challenges. For example, it was difficult to collaborate on it as only one
        person has the physical device. Also, without a lab full of supplies it was hard to obtain the components
        required. Another major challenge we faced was powering the vehicle. We began powering the car with two 9 volt
        and four AA batteries. However, this wasn't enough power. When the car turned it would reset the Arduino and
        disconnect the bluetooth. After doing some research and brainstorming we decided to switch out a 9 volt battery
        and the AAs for a 12 volt lithium ion battery. This change improved the cars battery however it did not fix the
        problem. After large turns, the Arduino would still reset and the bluetooth would disconnect. To fix this
        problem we added a delay in the servo code to make it turn slightly slower causing less battery consumption and
        fixing the problem. Some other challenges we faced were connecting the motor to the drive shaft, correcting the
        tie rods allignment to prevent uneven turning, fitting the battery and other components in the car, and much
        more.
